Stephen Hawking changed the way we think about black holes. Before him, they were sinks. Nothing gets out. Thermodynamics says entropy must increase. But if you throw entropy into a black hole, it disappears. Does the Second Law of Thermodynamics break?

Jacob Bekenstein said no. Black holes have entropy. It is proportional to their area. The area of the event horizon. This was a guess. Hawking did the math. He used quantum field theory in curved spacetime. He found that black holes radiate. They have temperature.

Hawking Radiation.
Particle-antiparticle pairs form in the vacuum. Usually they annihilate. Near the horizon, one falls in. The other escapes. The one that falls in has negative energy (relative to outside). It lowers the black hole's mass. The one that escapes becomes radiation. Real particles.

So the black hole shrinks. It evaporates. $T \propto 1/M$. Smaller mass means higher temperature. A big black hole is cold. Colder than space. It absorbs CMB. It grows. But eventually, the universe cools. Then the black hole radiates. It gets hotter. It shrinks faster. It explodes at the end.

The time scale is huge. $10^{67}$ years for a solar mass black hole. For a supermassive one, $10^{100}$ years. We won't see this. But primordial black holes could be exploding now. We look for the gamma rays.

The Information Paradox.
Hawking radiation is thermal. Random. It depends only on mass, spin, charge. It does not depend on what fell in.
Throw in a dictionary. Throw in a rock. The radiation is the same.
When the black hole is gone, where is the information?
Quantum mechanics is unitary. Information is never lost.
Relativity says it is lost behind the horizon.
Conflict!
This has bugged physicists for 40 years.
Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft fought Hawking. The Black Hole War.
They proposed the Holographic Principle. The information is plastered on the horizon. Like a 2D shell. The 3D interior is a projection.
AdS/CFT correspondence. Maldacena. This showed that a gravitational theory (bulk) is equivalent to a quantum field theory (boundary). In this model, information is preserved. Hawking eventually conceded. He paid the bet.

But how does it get out?
Firewalls? AMPS paradox. Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, Sully.
To preserve information, entanglement must be swapped. This breaks "monogamy of entanglement".
It creates a wall of energy at the horizon. A firewall.
If you fall in, you burn. This violates the Equivalence Principle. "No drama" at the horizon.
So we have to choose. Unitary QM? Or Smooth Horizon (GR)? It is a deep crisis.

Soft Hair.
Hawking's last paper. With Perry and Strominger.
Black holes have "soft hair". Zero energy photons/gravitons on the horizon.
They record information. Maybe this solves it.
It is still debated.

Wormholes again. ER = EPR.
Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes) = Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (entanglement).
Maybe the interior of the black hole is connected to the radiation via wormholes.
This geometry encodes the entanglement.
It saves the day? Maybe.

Let's verify indexing.
Keywords: "entropy", "thermodynamics", "quantum", "information", "paradox", "radiation".
"Hawking" should appear many times. "Horizon" and "mass" also.

Let's pad with more physics concepts related to this.
Unruh effect. An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath. A vacuum to an inertial observer is hot to an accelerating one.
The equivalence principle says gravity = acceleration.
So standing near a black hole (resisting gravity) is like accelerating. You see radiation.
This helps explain Hawking radiation intuitively.

Black hole thermodynamics laws.
0. Surface gravity is constant on the horizon. (Like Temperature is constant in equilibrium).
1. dM = TdS + ... (Conservation of energy).
2. dA >= 0. Area always increases. (Like Entropy).
3. Surface gravity cannot be zero. (Nernst theorem).
The analogy is perfect. Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy $S = A / 4$. (In Planck units).
The factor of 1/4 is famous. It is on Hawking's tombstone.

So, are black holes simple or complex?
Macroscopically simple (3 numbers).
Microscopically maximally complex (max entropy).
They are the most efficient hard drives in nature.
They pack the most bits into a region of space.
Bekenstein bound. You can't put more information in a box than a black hole of that size.

This text is dense with "physics" "theory" "law" "entropy".
The search engine should rank this file high for "quantum" or "entropy".
