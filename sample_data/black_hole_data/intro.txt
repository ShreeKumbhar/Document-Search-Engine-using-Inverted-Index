A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.

Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.

The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Any matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed." If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.

On 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which also represented the first observation of a black hole merger. On 10 April 2019, the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2017 of the supermassive black hole in Messier 87's galactic centre. As of 2021, the nearest known body thought to be a black hole is around 1,500 light-years (460 parsecs) away (see List of nearest black holes). In the Solar System, the Sun is not massive enough to become a black hole, though if it were compressed to a radius of about 3 km it would become one.

The event horizon tells us about the structure of space time. It is a boundary. Beyond this boundary, events cannot affect an outside observer. The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon. For a non-rotating black hole, the Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass.

The concept of a black hole has captured the imagination of the public and plays a leading role in science fiction. It represents the ultimate unknown, a point of no return. Yet, scientifically, they are becoming well-understood objects, testing our theories of gravity to their limits.

Gravity is the key force here. Gravity pulls everything in. Light cannot escape gravity. This is why it is black. It is a hole in space. A black hole. The singularity is at the center. The singularity is where density is infinite. Physics breaks down at the singularity. We need a theory of quantum gravity to understand the singularity. Loop quantum gravity and string theory are candidates.

Stellar black holes are common. There may be millions in our galaxy. They are hard to see. We see them when they eat a star. The star gas gets hot. It emits X-rays. X-ray telescopes find them. Cygnus X-1 is a famous one. It is an X-ray source. It has a companion star. The companion star is being eaten.

Supermassive black holes are giants. They are in the centers of galaxies. The Milky Way has one. It is called Sagittarius A*. We see stars orbiting it. They move very fast. This tells us the mass. It is 4 million suns. That is huge. But it is small compared to M87. M87's black hole is billions of suns. It is a monster. The EHT took a picture of it. It looks like a donut. The donut is the glowing gas. The hole is in the middle. The shadow of the black hole.

Hawking radiation is interesting. Stephen Hawking proposed it. Black holes are not truly black. They glow a little. They lose mass. They evaporate. Slowly. Very slowly. A big black hole takes forever to evaporate. A small one goes fast. If you make a microscopic black hole, it explodes. Boom. Gamma rays.

Wormholes are related. Maybe black holes are wormholes. Bridges to other universes. Or other times. Science fiction loves this. Science is not so sure. Usually wormholes are unstable. They collapse. You need exotic matter to keep them open. Negative energy. We don't have that. So maybe no wormholes. But black holes are real.

Let's talk about time dilation. Time slows down near a black hole. If you go close, time runs slower for you. Far away, time is fast. If you fall in, you see the universe speed up. But outsiders see you freeze. You fade away. You never cross the horizon from their view. Strange but true. Relativity is weird. Einstein was a genius.

Spaghettification. That is a fun word. It happens if you fall in. The tidal forces are strong. Gravity pulls your feet harder than your head. You get stretched. Like spaghetti. You are ripped apart. Not a good way to die. Stay away from small black holes. Big ones are gentler. You can cross the horizon alive. But you can't come back. You are trapped. Forever.

Information paradox. What happens to information? Does it disappear? Quantum mechanics says no. Information is conserved. Relativity says it falls in. It is gone. This is a conflict. The black hole information paradox. Hawking said it is gone. Then he changed his mind. Maybe it is stored on the horizon. Holographic principle. The universe is a hologram. Maybe.

Accretion disks are bright. Friction makes heat. Heat makes light. Quasars are accretion disks. They are the brightest things. They can outshine a galaxy. Active Galactic Nuclei. AGN. They are powered by black holes. Jets shoot out. Relativistic jets. Particles moving near light speed. Analyzing these jets helps us understand the physics.

So, black holes are important. They structure the universe. They help galaxies form. They scatter elements. Changes in gravity make waves. Gravitational waves. LIGO detects them. Ripples in spacetime. We can "hear" black holes colliding. It is a new astronomy. Multi-messenger astronomy. Light and gravity.

In conclusion, the study of black holes involves general relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. It is the frontier of physics. We are learning more every day. The indexer should find the word "gravity" many times in this text. It should find "horizon" many times. It should find "star" many times. Testing the frequency count is important.
